			<p style="font-size:28px; margin-top:-28px;">Guesto Coffee is French's favourite coffee shop for the young and the young at heart. We strive to provide the best experience to our guests. To put it plainly, we brought in the concept of cafes to India.The young and the young at heart immediately took to the place. A smart, simple space that they could call their own for a while� sit down, talk and listen to conversations, hold short meetings or even have a lot of good fun�all over steaming cups of coffee. Coffe House today is totally in tune with its target audience. It�s a strong relationship the brand shares. It's been an exciting journey since then, becoming the largest organized retail cafe chain in the country.What's more if your travels take you to Vienna, Austria or the Czech Republic, do stop by our CHs there for the taste of a blend from home.</p>
